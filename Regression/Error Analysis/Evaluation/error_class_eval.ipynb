      "\n",
      "1. **High-Value Bias**: This category includes predictions where the model significantly overestimates the value of high-end or luxury vehicles. This could be due to the model placing too much weight on features like brand, engine size, or power, without adequately considering depreciation factors or market demand for these vehicles.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Underestimation of Popular Models**: Here, the model underestimates the value of cars that are popular in the market, possibly due to their reliability, brand loyalty, or resale value. This could be because the model does not adequately account for the intangible aspects that contribute to a car's market value.\n",

      "\n",
      "    - Occurrences: Task 1 (Ford Endeavour 3.0L 4X2 AT), Task 7 (Hyundai Xcent 1.2 CRDi E)\n",
      "    - Total: 2\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Misjudgment of Market Trends**: These are errors where the model fails to accurately predict prices due to not considering current market trends, such as the increasing demand for SUVs and crossovers or the depreciation rate of certain models.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Occurrences: Task 9 (Mahindra Bolero 2011-2019 SLE), Task 10 (Ford Figo Aspire 1.5 TDCi Titanium), Task 13 (Maruti Ertiga ZDI), Task 14 (Renault Duster 110PS Diesel RxZ), Task 15 (Tata New Safari DICOR 2.2 VX 4x2)\n",
      "    - Total: 5\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Overestimation for Older Models**: This includes predictions where the model overestimates the value of older vehicles, possibly due to not adequately penalizing the age or km driven.\n",

      "Based on the provided examples of wrong predictions, we can categorize the faults into distinct categories. These categories are derived from the common patterns observed in the explanations and the discrepancies between the predicted and actual prices. Here are the identified fault categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Misjudgment of Vehicle Age Impact**: This category includes predictions where the model year of the vehicle significantly impacted its value, but the importance assigned to the year was either too low or misinterpreted, leading to a substantial deviation from the actual price.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Underestimation of Mileage's Impact**: Predictions that fall into this category did not accurately account for the effect of the vehicle's mileage (km driven) on its selling price. Either the mileage was given too little importance, or its impact was misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Overlooking Market Trends or Specific Model Popularity**: Some predictions seem to miss the mark due to not considering the popularity of specific models or general market trends that could affect a vehicle's price. This could be due to a lack of updated market data or an underestimation of the model's name and its demand in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incorrect Valuation of Vehicle Condition and Ownership History**: This includes predictions where the condition of the vehicle (indicated by the number of previous owners, for example) was not accurately factored into the price. Vehicles with more owners or higher wear and tear typically sell for less, which was not always correctly accounted for.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Misinterpretation of Technical Specifications**: Predictions in this category incorrectly valued the vehicle based on its technical specifications, such as engine size, max power, and fuel type. The importance given to these attributes did not align well with their actual impact on the vehicle's market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Neglecting Seller Type and Transaction Mode Influence**: Some predictions did not adequately consider the influence of the seller type (individual, dealer, or trustmark dealer) and the mode of transaction on the final selling price. Vehicles sold by dealers or through certified programs can command higher prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequency of Occurrence:\n",
      "- Misjudgment of Vehicle Age Impact: 5 occurrences\n",
      "- Underestimation of Mileage's Impact: 4 occurrences\n",
      "- Overlooking Market Trends or Specific Model Popularity: 3 occurrences\n",
      "- Incorrect Valuation of Vehicle Condition and Ownership History: 4 occurrences\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Misjudgment of Market Value Based on Attributes**:\n",
      "   - This occurs when the prediction significantly undervalues or overvalues the car despite having attributes that should command a higher or lower price in the market. For example, Task 2, where the Hyundai EON Era Plus was undervalued despite its attributes that should command a higher price.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: 5\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Overemphasis on Mileage and Year**:\n",
      "   - Predictions in this category are overly influenced by the car's mileage and year, without adequately considering other critical factors such as the car's condition, brand, or market demand. For instance, Task 5 and Task 17, where the predictions were significantly off due to an overemphasis on high mileage or the car's age.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: 6\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Underestimation of Brand Value or Model Popularity**:\n",
      "   - These faults occur when the prediction fails to account for the additional value brought by the car's brand or the specific model's popularity. For example, Task 6 and Task 11, where the Toyota Yaris and Renault Koleos were undervalued, possibly due to underestimating the brand's value or model's demand.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: 4\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Neglecting the Impact of Seller Type or Ownership History**:\n",
      "   - In some cases, the prediction does not adequately consider the car being sold by a dealer or the number of previous owners, which can significantly affect the car's market value. For instance, Task 3, where the Chevrolet Optra Magnum's value was underestimated, possibly due to not considering its fourth & above ownership status adequately.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: 3\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Overlooking Specific Attributes or Condition**:\n",
      "   - This category includes predictions where specific attributes or the overall condition of the car (e.g., engine size, power, or special features) were not given enough weight in the valuation. For example, Task 14 and Task 18, where the predictions did not seem to account for the high mileage or engine power adequately.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: 2\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the most common fault categories are the overemphasis on mileage and year, followed by misjudgment of market value based on attributes. These categories highlight areas where the predictive model could improve, such as by better understanding the nuanced impact of various attributes on a car's market value and incorporating more comprehensive data on brand value and model popularity.\n",

      "   - Occurrences: Task 16\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Underestimation of Market Demand or Trends**:\n",
      "   - In these cases, the LLM failed to accurately account for current market demand or trends that could affect the selling price of the vehicle.\n",
      "   - No clear occurrences identified explicitly, but it could be an underlying factor in several misjudgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incorrect Assessment of Ownership and Seller Type Impact**:\n",
      "   - Predictions where the LLM did not correctly evaluate how the type of seller (individual vs. dealer) or the number of previous owners would influence the selling price.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: Task 4, Task 7, Task 20\n",
      "\n",

      "Analyzing the provided data, the incorrect predictions can be grouped into distinct fault categories based on the nature of the errors observed. Here are the identified categories along with the frequency of their occurrence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inadequate Consideration of Vehicle Age** (5 occurrences): This category includes predictions where the model year of the vehicle significantly impacts its value, but the prediction does not adequately account for the depreciation or value retention associated with the vehicle's age. Examples include Task 4 (Maruti Zen Classic, 1998), Task 8 (Mahindra Bolero SLX, 2007), and Task 11 (Maruti Zen Estilo 1.1 LX BSIII, 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Overemphasis on Mileage and Engine Specifications** (3 occurrences): Predictions that overly focus on the vehicle's mileage or engine specifications, leading to inaccurate pricing. For instance, Task 5 (Toyota Corolla DX, 2005) and Task 18 (Chevrolet Spark 1.0 LT Option Pack w/ Airbag, 2009) fall into this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Neglect of Market Trends and Brand Value** (4 occurrences): These predictions fail to consider the brand's market value or specific trends affecting certain models' resale value. Task 6 (Mercedes-Benz New C-Class C 200 Kompressor Elegance AT, 2007) and Task 17 (Fiat Grande Punto 1.3 Emotion, 2011) are examples where the brand's value or model-specific trends might have been overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Misjudgment of Vehicle Condition Based on Ownership and Usage** (2 occurrences): Incorrect predictions due to not properly evaluating the vehicle's condition inferred from the number of previous owners or the kilometers driven. Task 7 (Hyundai Verna 1.6 SX, 2011) and Task 15 (Ford Figo Diesel ZXI, 2014) are examples where the condition inferred from ownership and usage was likely misjudged.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Inaccurate Weighting of Attributes** (4 occurrences): These are cases where the prediction model incorrectly weighted certain vehicle attributes, leading to a significant deviation from the actual price. For example, Task 9 (Mahindra Bolero 2011-2019 SLE) and Task 14 (Maruti SX4 ZXI AT, 2011) show signs of attributes being weighted in a way that doesn't align well with their actual impact on the vehicle's market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Lack of Consideration for Missing Information** (2 occurrences): Predictions that did not adequately account for missing information, which could have led to overestimation or underestimation of the vehicle's value. Task 2 (Maruti Swift VDI BSIV W ABS, 2011) and Task 12 (Hyundai Santro Xing XL, 2006) are instances where missing data (e.g., mileage, engine specs) might have been critical for an accurate prediction.\n",

      "Based on the provided examples, the incorrect predictions can be grouped into distinct fault categories as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High Mileage Overlook**: This category includes cases where the prediction failed to adequately account for the high mileage of the vehicle, which typically decreases the vehicle's value. This fault occurred in Task 3, where the car had 150,000 km driven but was predicted to have a higher price than the actual.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Owner Count Misjudgment**: Predictions that did not properly factor in the depreciation associated with the number of previous owners fall into this category. For instance, Task 6, where the car had a \"Second Owner\" status but was predicted to have a higher price than the actual.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Year of Manufacture Misinterpretation**: This category includes predictions that inaccurately assessed the impact of the vehicle's year of manufacture on its price. An example is Task 17, where the vehicle's year (2011) was not given enough weight in the prediction, leading to a significant underestimation of its price.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Kilometers Driven Underestimation**: Predictions that failed to properly account for the effect of the kilometers driven on the vehicle's value. For example, Task 18, where the car had 91,000 km driven but was predicted to have a higher price than the actual.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Vehicle Condition and Features Overlook**: This includes cases where the prediction did not sufficiently consider the vehicle's condition or specific features that could affect its price. Task 19 is an example, where the prediction significantly underestimated the price, possibly due to not fully considering the vehicle's condition or features.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Market Trends and Model Popularity Ignorance**: This category is for predictions that might not have considered current market trends or the popularity of specific models, which can greatly affect vehicle prices. While not explicitly mentioned in the tasks, it's a potential underlying issue in several incorrect predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Transmission Type Impact Misjudgment**: Incorrect predictions that did not accurately assess the impact of the transmission type (Manual or Automatic) on the vehicle's price. For example, Task 18, where the prediction might have underestimated the value added by an automatic transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Fuel Type Impact Misjudgment**: This includes predictions that failed to properly consider how the type of fuel (Petrol or Diesel) influences the vehicle's price. Task 20 could fall into this category if the diesel variant was undervalued in the prediction.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Misjudgment of Vehicle Age Impact**: This category includes predictions where the model year of the vehicle was not accurately factored into the price estimation. For example, older vehicles were sometimes predicted to have higher prices than they actually did, not accounting sufficiently for depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Overlooking High Mileage**: In several cases, the high mileage of a vehicle, which significantly impacts its value, was not adequately considered, leading to overestimations of the vehicle's worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Owner History Misinterpretation**: The number of previous owners and its impact on the vehicle's price was another area of fault. Cars with multiple previous owners, which would typically lower the price, were not always adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incorrect Valuation of Vehicle Condition and Specifications**: This includes cases where specific attributes such as engine size, max power, and additional features (e.g., automatic transmission) were either overvalued or undervalued in the context of their impact on the overall price.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Trend Misalignment**: Some predictions did not align with general market trends, such as the demand for certain models or the impact of fuel type on a vehicle's resale value.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Inaccurate Comparison with Example Outputs**: In some instances, the prediction seemed to overly rely on the example outputs without considering the unique aspects of the new task, leading to incorrect price estimations.\n",
