      "\n",
      "1. **Misjudgment of Market Value Due to Vehicle Age**:\n",
      "   - This category includes predictions where the model significantly misjudged the impact of the vehicle's age on its market value.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: Task 1 (Maruti 800 Std, 1999)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Weighting of Vehicle Condition and Ownership**:\n",
      "   - Predictions falling into this category did not accurately account for the vehicle's condition (e.g., km driven, number of owners) in determining its value.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: Task 3 (Chevrolet Optra Magnum, Fourth & Above Owner), Task 5 (Toyota Innova with high mileage)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact**:\n",
      "   - Here, the model failed to properly evaluate the impact of specific car models, their engine specifications, and features on the selling price.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: Task 2 (Hyundai EON Era Plus), Task 4 (Hyundai i20 1.4 CRDi Asta), Task 6 (Toyota Yaris V BSIV), Task 7 (Ford EcoSport 1.5 Petrol Titanium Plus BSIV), Task 10 (Toyota Fortuner 3.0 Diesel)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Overlooking Market Trends and Demand**:\n",
      "   - Predictions in this category did not consider the current market trends and demand for certain vehicle types, leading to inaccurate price estimations.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: None explicitly mentioned, but could be inferred in cases where the model's popularity or demand might have influenced actual prices significantly (e.g., Task 10's Toyota Fortuner).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Misinterpretation of High Mileage Impact**:\n",
      "   - This category includes predictions where the model failed to accurately assess the negative impact of high mileage on the vehicle's selling price.\n",
      "   - Occurrences: Task 5 (Toyota Innova with 193623 km driven), Task 7 (Ford EcoSport with 90000 km driven)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frequency of Occurrences**:\n",
      "- Misjudgment of Market Value Due to Vehicle Age: 1\n",
      "- Incorrect Weighting of Vehicle Condition and Ownership: 2\n",
      "- Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact: 5\n",
      "- Overlooking Market Trends and Demand: 0 (inferred)\n",
      "- Misinterpretation of High Mileage Impact: 2\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**:\n",
      "The most common fault category is the \"Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact,\" with five occurrences, indicating that the model often fails to recognize the significant influence of specific car models, their engine specifications, and features on their market value. The next most common faults relate to the incorrect weighting of vehicle condition and ownership, and the misinterpretation of high mileage impact, each contributing to the model's inability to accurately predict used car prices.\n",
