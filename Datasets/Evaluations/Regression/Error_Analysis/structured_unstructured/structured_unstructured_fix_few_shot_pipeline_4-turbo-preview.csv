- Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so the 2014 model year suggests a relatively higher price.
- Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates a higher price, so the 81000 km_driven may slightly lower the price.
- Fuel Type: Diesel cars tend to have higher resale value in India, positively impacting the price.
- Seller Type: Dealer cars may have a higher price compared to individual sellers.
- Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can positively influence the price.

1. Year: 2012 - This indicates that the car is around 9-10 years old, which affects its depreciation and overall value.
2. Kilometers Driven: 330000 - High mileage typically leads to a lower selling price as it indicates more wear and tear on the vehicle.
3. Fuel: Petrol - Petrol cars generally have lower running costs compared to diesel cars, which can influence the price.
4. Transmission: Manual - Manual transmissions are usually preferred in the Indian market and can impact the resale value.
5. Owner: Second Owner - Multiple ownership can sometimes lower the resale value of a car.
6. Engine Power: 198.25 bhp - Higher engine power can positively influence the price of the car.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the older year of 2003 for the Maruti Wagon R LXI would lower its predicted price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower km_driven values typically indicate less wear and tear, positively impacting the price. The 40000 km_driven for the Maruti Wagon R LXI is relatively low.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale values compared to petrol cars due to better mileage and lower running costs. The Maruti Wagon R LXI being petrol-powered might have a slightly lower predicted price.
4. Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can influence the price positively. The 18.9 kmpl mileage of the Maruti Wagon R LXI is decent.
5. Engine Capacity and Power: Higher engine capacity and power can lead to a higher price. The 998 CC engine with 67.1 bhp for the Maruti Wagon R LXI might have a moderate impact on the price.
6. Other factors like owner history, transmission type, and seating capacity also play a role in determining the price.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes:
1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so a car from 2015 is likely to have a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, so a car with 80000 km driven may have a higher price compared to higher mileage cars.
3. Engine Capacity: A larger engine capacity of 2523 CC may contribute to a higher price.
4. Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value in the Indian market.
5. Owner: Being a first owner can positively impact the price as it implies potentially better maintenance and care.

4. Seller Type: Dealer - Dealer-sold cars tend to be priced higher.
5. Transmission: Automatic - Automatic cars are usually priced higher than manual ones.
6. Mileage: 19.62 kmpl - Higher mileage efficiency can positively impact the price.

3. Fuel: Petrol - Petrol cars usually have higher demand compared to diesel cars in the Indian market.
4. Owner: Second Owner - Multiple owners can decrease the value of a used car.
5. Mileage: 18.5 kmpl - Good mileage can positively impact the selling price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2015 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates a higher price, so the 33000 km_driven value influenced the prediction positively.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars often have higher demand and prices compared to diesel cars in the Indian market.
4. Transmission: Manual transmissions are more common and preferred in the Indian market, affecting the price positively.
5. Owner: First owner status is desirable and can positively impact the price.
6. Engine Power: Higher max_power (91.1 bhp) suggests a more powerful engine, which can influence the price positively.

1. Year: 2008 - Older cars generally have lower resale value.
2. Kilometers Driven: 40000 - Lower mileage typically leads to a higher selling price.
3. Fuel: Diesel - Diesel cars often have higher resale value compared to petrol cars.
4. Mileage: 16.8 kmpl - Higher mileage efficiency can positively impact the selling price.
5. Engine Power: 62 bhp - Lower engine power may slightly lower the price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally command higher prices, so the 2019 Tata Tigor is likely to have a higher value compared to older models.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage indicates less wear and tear, which can positively impact the price. The Tata Tigor with only 14000 km driven is expected to have a higher value.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are generally more popular in the Indian market, which can influence the price positively.
4. Owner: Being a first owner typically adds value to the car as it implies fewer previous users and potentially better maintenance.
5. Engine Power: The Tata Tigor with 84 bhp is considered decent for its segment, which can influence the price positively.

Considering these factors, I predicted the selling price of the Tata Tigor 1.2 Revotron XZ to be 525000 INR."

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the older year of 2006 for the Maruti Wagon R LXI would lower the predicted price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Higher mileage typically leads to a lower price, so the high km_driven value of 110000 would decrease the predicted price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars tend to have lower prices compared to diesel cars, which is a factor in predicting a lower price for the Maruti Wagon R LXI.
4. Owner: Fourth & Above Owner indicates multiple previous owners, which can decrease the perceived value of the car and thus lower the predicted price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally command higher prices, so the 2016 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Higher mileage typically leads to a lower price, so the 140,000 km driven may lower the price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are generally priced lower than diesel cars, so this attribute may have a slight impact.
4. Transmission: Manual transmissions are more common and may not significantly affect the price.
5. Owner: Being a first owner can positively impact the price.
6. Engine Power: Higher engine power (117.3 bhp) may contribute to a higher price.
7. Seating Capacity: 7-seater cars can have a higher demand, potentially influencing the price.

3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often preferred in the Indian market, which is the case here.
4. Owner: Being a First Owner can positively impact the price as it implies fewer previous users.
5. Mileage: Higher mileage efficiency at 22.74 kmpl is attractive to buyers.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes and their values that had a high influence on the decision:

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the older year of 2003 would lower the predicted price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower km_driven tends to increase the price, so the relatively low 70000 km_driven would have a positive impact.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars usually have lower prices compared to diesel cars, which would slightly lower the predicted price.
4. Owner: Fourth & Above Owner indicates higher ownership changes, which typically decreases the price.
5. Engine Capacity: The engine capacity of 998 CC is smaller compared to the other examples, which would lower the predicted price.

Considering these factors, the predicted price for the Maruti Wagon R VXI is 90000 INR."

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2018 Maruti Baleno Alpha 1.3 is likely to have a higher price compared to older cars.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage cars tend to have higher prices, so the relatively low mileage of 38817 km on the Maruti Baleno Alpha 1.3 positively influences the price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars typically have higher resale value in the Indian market, so being a diesel vehicle is a positive factor.
4. Seller Type: Dealer-sold cars often have higher prices compared to individual sellers, so being sold by a dealer is likely to increase the price.
5. Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can positively impact the price, so the high mileage of 27.39 kmpl is a positive factor.
6. Engine Power: The engine power of 74 bhp is moderate and can influence the price positively.
7. Torque: The torque of 190Nm at 2000rpm is decent and can contribute to a higher price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so the 2016 Mahindra XUV500 W10 2WD is likely to have a higher price compared to older cars.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage indicates less wear and tear, which can positively impact the price. The 25000 km driven by the car is relatively low.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars tend to have higher resale value in the Indian market.
4. Transmission: Manual transmission cars are more popular and may have a slightly higher price compared to automatic transmission cars.
5. Owner: Being a first owner can increase the perceived value of the car.
6. Engine Power: The Mahindra XUV500 W10 2WD has a powerful engine with 140 bhp and 330Nm torque, which can influence the price positively.
7. Seating Capacity: The 7-seater configuration can also impact the price positively.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes and values that had a high influence on the decision:

1. Year: 2017 - Newer cars generally command higher prices in the used car market.
2. Kilometers Driven: 46000 - Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, positively impacting the price.
3. Fuel: Diesel - Diesel cars often have higher resale value due to better fuel efficiency and lower running costs.
4. Transmission: Automatic - Automatic transmissions are preferred by many buyers, potentially increasing the price.
5. Engine: 2179 CC - A larger engine size can contribute to a higher price.
6. Max Power: 140 bhp - Higher power output can make the car more desirable, influencing the price.

Considering these factors, I estimated the selling price of the Mahindra XUV500 AT W6 2WD to be 1200000 INR."

3. Engine Power: Higher engine power often correlates with a higher price.
4. Transmission Type: Automatic transmissions usually increase the price compared to manual transmissions.

3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars are typically valued higher in the Indian market, positively affecting the price prediction.
4. Transmission: Manual transmissions are more common and preferred in the Indian market, which positively influenced the prediction.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes and values that had a high influence on the decision:

1. Year: Newer cars generally command higher prices, so the 2015 model year of the Maruti Ertiga ZXI suggests a higher value.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage indicates less wear and tear, so the 35000 km_driven value positively impacts the price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often preferred in the Indian market, which could contribute to a higher price compared to diesel cars.
4. Transmission: Manual transmissions are more common and preferred in the Indian market, potentially influencing the price positively.
5. Owner: Being a First Owner typically adds value to a used car.
6. Engine Power: The higher max_power of 93.7 bhp could lead to a higher price.
7. Seating Capacity: The 7.0 seats could be a desirable feature for potential buyers, affecting the price positively.

Considering these factors, I predicted the selling price of the Maruti Ertiga ZXI to be 675000 INR."

2. Kilometers Driven: 100,000 - Higher mileage typically decreases the price.
3. Fuel: Diesel - Diesel cars generally have a higher resale value.
4. Mileage: 11.5 kmpl - Lower mileage efficiency may slightly impact the price.
5. Engine: 2982 CC - Larger engine size can positively influence the price.
6. Max Power: 171 bhp - Higher power output can increase the price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2013 model year suggests a relatively higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Higher mileage typically leads to a lower price, so the 110,000 km driven may lower the price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value compared to petrol cars in the Indian market.
4. Owner: Second Owner may slightly lower the price compared to a first-owner vehicle.
5. Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can positively impact the price.
6. Engine Power: Higher max power and torque can influence the price positively.

2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, so the 52000 km_driven value is relatively low.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars are often preferred in the Indian market, contributing to a higher price.
4. Mileage: The higher mileage of 24.3 kmpl is attractive to buyers and can positively impact the price.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2018 model year suggests a relatively higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage indicates less wear and tear, which can positively impact the price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars tend to have lower running costs compared to diesel, which can affect the price.
4. Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can influence the price positively.
5. Engine Capacity: Smaller engine capacity may lead to a lower price compared to larger engines.
6. Max Power: Higher power output can increase the price.
7. Seats: More seating capacity can be a positive factor for the price.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes and their values:

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so the 2018 Maruti Wagon R VXI Plus is likely to have a higher price compared to older cars.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, so the 30000 km driven by the car suggests a higher price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often preferred in the Indian market, which could positively impact the price.
4. Transmission: Manual transmissions are more common and preferred in India, potentially influencing the price.
5. Owner: Being a first owner can increase the perceived value of the car.
6. Engine Power: The engine power of 67.04 bhp is moderate, which may affect the price.
7. Other factors such as mileage, torque, and seating capacity also play a role in determining the price.

Considering these factors, I estimated the selling price of the 2018 Maruti Wagon R VXI Plus to be 425000 INR."

- Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2017 model year suggests a higher value.
- Kilometers driven: Lower mileage typically correlates with a higher price, so the 60000 km_driven value influenced the prediction.
- Fuel type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value compared to petrol cars in the Indian market.
- Owner: First owner cars are usually valued higher than second or third owner cars.
- Engine power: The higher max_power of 88.73 bhp indicates a more powerful engine, which can impact the price positively.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes:
- Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so the 2016 Hyundai EON Sportz is relatively recent.
- Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, so the 35000 km driven is moderate.
- Fuel Type: Petrol cars are more popular in India, which positively impacts the price.
- Owner: Being a first owner adds value to the car.
- Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable, so the 21.1 kmpl is a positive factor.
- Engine Power: The 55.2 bhp engine power is considered moderate for this segment.

Considering these factors, I estimated the selling price of the Hyundai EON Sportz to be 325,000 INR."

2. Kilometers Driven: 30000 - Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, positively impacting the price.
3. Fuel: Diesel - Diesel cars often have higher resale value due to better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs.
4. Transmission: Manual - Manual transmissions are preferred by some buyers and can influence the price.
5. Owner: First Owner - Fewer owners usually lead to a higher resale value.
6. Engine Power: 98.96 bhp - Higher engine power can increase the price.

2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates a higher price, so the 35000 km_driven value influenced the prediction positively.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often priced higher than diesel cars in the Indian market, so the Petrol fuel type had a positive impact.
4. Transmission: Automatic transmissions usually increase the price of a car, so the Automatic transmission type positively influenced the prediction.
5. Owner: First Owner status is preferred by buyers and can lead to a higher selling price.
6. Engine Power: The engine power of 67 bhp is considered moderate and influenced the prediction.
7. Other features such as mileage, engine capacity, torque, and seating capacity also played a role in determining the predicted price.

Considering these factors, the predicted price for the Maruti Wagon R AMT VXI is 425000 INR."

- Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so a 2016 model is considered favorable.
- Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage is preferred, so the high value of 108000 km driven may slightly decrease the price.
- Fuel Type: Diesel cars tend to have higher resale value in India.
- Seller Type: Dealer cars may have a higher price compared to individual sellers.
- Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable, so the good mileage of 23.65 kmpl may positively impact the price.
- Engine Power: The engine power of 88.5 bhp is moderate and may influence the price.
- Torque: The torque of 200Nm at 1750rpm is decent and can affect the price positively.

3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often preferred in the Indian market, potentially increasing the price.
4. Owner: Being a first owner can increase the perceived value of the car.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the older year of 2000 for the Maruti Alto LX would likely result in a lower price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Higher mileage typically leads to a lower price, so the high value of 206000 km for the Maruti Alto LX would have a significant negative impact on the price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars tend to have higher resale values compared to petrol cars, so the fact that the Maruti Alto LX runs on petrol would contribute to a lower price.
4. Owner: The Maruti Alto LX being owned by a Fourth & Above Owner indicates multiple previous owners, which can decrease the price due to concerns about maintenance and wear.
5. Engine Size and Power: The smaller engine size and lower power output of the Maruti Alto LX compared to the other examples would also influence the price to be lower.

Considering these factors, the predicted price for the Maruti Alto LX is 150000 INR."

- Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2016 Skoda Rapid is likely to have a higher value.
- Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically correlates with a higher price, so the 11000 km driven for the Skoda Rapid suggests a higher value.
- Fuel Type: Petrol cars are often priced higher than diesel cars in the Indian market.
- Transmission: Automatic transmission cars usually have a higher resale value compared to manual transmission cars.
- Owner: First owner cars tend to have higher resale values compared to second or third owner cars.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher value, so the 2018 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates a higher price, so the 80000 km_driven value may slightly lower the price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value in the Indian market.
4. Owner: Being a First Owner usually adds value to the car.
5. Engine Power: The max_power of 98.96 bhp is relatively high, which can positively impact the price.
6. Torque: The torque value of 205Nm is also significant for performance and can influence the price.

Considering these factors, I estimated the selling price of the Ford EcoSport 1.5 Diesel Titanium BSIV to be 750000 INR."

1. Year: Newer cars generally command higher prices, so the 2016 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage (11000 km in this case) typically indicates a well-maintained car and can lead to a higher price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars often have higher demand in the Indian market, influencing the price positively.
4. Transmission: Automatic transmission cars are usually priced higher than manual ones, contributing to a higher predicted price.
5. Engine Power: The higher engine power of 103.5 bhp can also positively impact the price prediction.

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2018 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates a higher price, so the relatively low 25,000 km driven influenced the prediction.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars often have higher demand and prices compared to diesel cars in the Indian market.
4. Transmission: Automatic transmission cars usually have higher prices compared to manual transmission cars.
5. Owner: First owner cars are generally priced higher than second or third owner cars.
6. Engine Power: The engine power of 81.86 bhp is considered decent and can influence the price positively.

- Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, so the 80000 km driven is moderate.
- Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value in India due to better fuel efficiency and lower running costs.
- Mileage: The high mileage of 25.01 kmpl is attractive to buyers looking for fuel-efficient vehicles.
- Engine Power and Torque: The engine power of 89.75 bhp and torque of 204Nm are decent for this segment.
- Brand and Model: Ford Fiesta is a reputable brand and the 1.5 TDCi Trend variant is popular in the market.

]","I made the prediction based on the following key attributes and their values:

1. Year: Newer cars generally have higher prices, so the 2017 Honda Jazz is likely to have a higher price compared to older cars.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage cars tend to have higher prices, so the 50000 km driven by the Honda Jazz is favorable for a higher price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars typically have higher resale value in the Indian market, contributing to a higher predicted price for the Honda Jazz.
4. Mileage: The higher mileage of 27.3 kmpl for the Honda Jazz indicates good fuel efficiency, which can positively impact the price.
5. Engine Power: The engine power of 98.6 bhp for the Honda Jazz is relatively high, which can influence the price positively.

1. Year: Newer cars generally command higher prices, so the 2017 model year suggests a higher price.
2. Kilometers Driven: Lower mileage typically indicates less wear and tear, positively impacting the price.
3. Fuel Type: Diesel cars often have higher resale value due to better fuel efficiency and lower running costs.
4. Transmission: Automatic transmission cars are in higher demand and usually priced higher than manual transmission cars.
5. Owner: Being a first owner usually implies better maintenance and care, leading to a higher selling price.
6. Mileage: Higher mileage per liter is desirable and can positively affect the price.
7. Engine Power and Torque: Higher power and torque values can influence the price positively.

2. Kilometers Driven: Lower km_driven typically indicates less wear and tear, so the value of 58343 suggests a higher price.
3. Fuel Type: Petrol cars are generally priced lower than diesel cars, so the fuel type being Petrol may influence a slightly lower price.
4. Seller Type: Trustmark Dealer indicates a reputable seller, potentially leading to a higher price due to trust and reliability.

4. Mileage: A higher mileage per liter is desirable and can positively impact the price. The Maruti Vitara Brezza LDi Option with a mileage of 24.3 kmpl is efficient, contributing to a higher price.

]","I made the prediction based on the year, kilometers driven, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity, and power output of the Mahindra Scorpio SLX 2.6 Turbo 8 Str. These attributes are crucial in determining the resale value of a used car. The relatively older year (2007) and high mileage (110000 km) would lower the price, while the diesel fuel type, 2179 CC engine, and 120 bhp power output would positively influence the price. Considering these factors, I estimated the selling price to be 400000 INR."
