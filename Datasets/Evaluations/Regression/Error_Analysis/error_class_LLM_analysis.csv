",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Based on the provided examples, the wrong predictions can be grouped into three fault categories:

1. **Underestimation of Market Value**:
   - This occurs when the predicted price is significantly lower than the actual market price. 
   - Examples: Task 2 (Prediction: 180000, Actual: 270000), Task 3 (Prediction: 150000, Actual: 210000), Task 4 (Prediction: 350000, Actual: 500000), Task 6 (Prediction: 750000, Actual: 1000000), Task 7 (Prediction: 650000, Actual: 850000), Task 8 (Prediction: 200000, Actual: 270000), Task 10 (Prediction: 900000, Actual: 1200000).
   - Occurrences: 7

2. **Overestimation of Market Value**:
   - This occurs when the predicted price is significantly higher than the actual market price.
   - Examples: Task 1 (Prediction: 60000, Actual: 40000), Task 5 (Prediction: 450000, Actual: 330000), Task 9 (Prediction: 100000, Actual: 65000).
   - Occurrences: 3

3. **Incorrect Valuation Due to Attribute Misinterpretation**:
   - This category is a bit nuanced and could overlap with the first two, but it specifically refers to cases where the prediction might have gone wrong due to incorrect weighting or misunderstanding of the importance of certain attributes (e.g., overvaluing the impact of low mileage or undervaluing the impact of the car's age or condition based on the owner).
   - However, based on the provided examples, all wrong predictions seem to stem from either overestimation or underestimation directly, without clear evidence of misinterpretation beyond these two reasons. Thus, this category might not be applicable without more detailed insight into how the LLM interpreted each attribute beyond the importance scores provided.

Given the examples and explanations, it appears that all incorrect predictions fall into the first two categories: underestimation and overestimation of market value. There isn't explicit evidence in the provided data to categorize any errors as due to incorrect valuation from attribute misinterpretation beyond these two reasons.",structured_analysis
error_class_LLM,"In the following I will give you a few price prediction tasks together with a prediction decision, details about the decision and the actual price.
A wrong prediction is a prediction that deviates by more than 20 percent from the actual price. The Prediction was made by an LLM.
Can you please group the wrong decisions into 3 fault categories? Please also indicate how often each one occurs.
There are also some correct decisions (deviation of less than 20 percent) in the examples. Please just use them as a reference and don't categorize them.

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Based on the provided examples, the wrong predictions can be grouped into three fault categories:

1. **Underestimation of Market Value**:
   - This occurs when the predicted price is significantly lower than the actual market price. 
   - Examples: Task 2 (Prediction: 180000, Actual: 270000), Task 3 (Prediction: 150000, Actual: 210000), Task 4 (Prediction: 350000, Actual: 500000), Task 6 (Prediction: 750000, Actual: 1000000), Task 7 (Prediction: 650000, Actual: 850000), Task 8 (Prediction: 200000, Actual: 270000), Task 10 (Prediction: 900000, Actual: 1200000).
   - Occurrences: 7

2. **Overestimation of Market Value**:
   - This occurs when the predicted price is significantly higher than the actual market price.
   - Examples: Task 1 (Prediction: 60000, Actual: 40000), Task 5 (Prediction: 450000, Actual: 330000), Task 9 (Prediction: 100000, Actual: 65000).
   - Occurrences: 3

3. **Incorrect Valuation Based on Attributes**:
   - This category is for predictions that may not fit neatly into underestimation or overestimation but are incorrect due to a misinterpretation or incorrect weighting of the vehicle's attributes.
   - However, based on the provided examples, all incorrect predictions can be clearly categorized into either underestimation or overestimation, so this category does not have specific examples in this case.
   - Occurrences: 0

Summary:
- Underestimation of Market Value: 7 occurrences
- Overestimation of Market Value: 3 occurrences
- Incorrect Valuation Based on Attributes: 0 occurrences

3. **Misjudgment of Vehicle Attributes**:
   - Task 10: Predicted 900000 INR vs. Actual 1200000 INR (Possibly underestimated the impact of the vehicle's engine size and power)
   Occurrences: 1

4. **Incorrect Weighting of Attributes**:
   - This category is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the explanations where the importance given to certain attributes might not align well with their actual impact on the vehicle's market value. However, without specific knowledge of how these weights should ideally be distributed, it's challenging to pinpoint exact tasks under this category.

5. **Overlooking Key Attributes**:
   - Similar to Incorrect Weighting, this category would involve situations where the prediction model might have overlooked or failed to adequately consider key attributes that significantly affect a vehicle's price. Again, without explicit mention of missed attributes in the explanations, it's difficult to assign tasks to this category.

Given the information, the primary fault categories with clear examples are Underestimation of Market Value and Overestimation of Market Value, with Overestimation being the most common fault. Misjudgment of Vehicle Attributes is also present but less frequent. The last two categories, Incorrect Weighting of Attributes and Overlooking Key Attributes, are implied possibilities based on the nature of the task but cannot be directly assigned to specific tasks without more detailed analysis or insight into the expected model behavior.",structured_analysis

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Based on the provided examples of false predictions, we can categorize the wrong decisions into 5 fault categories as follows:

1. **Underestimation of Market Value**:
   - Task 2: Predicted 180000 INR vs. Actual 270000 INR
   - Task 3: Predicted 150000 INR vs. Actual 210000 INR
   - Task 4: Predicted 350000 INR vs. Actual 500000 INR
   - Task 6: Predicted 750000 INR vs. Actual 1000000 INR
   - Task 7: Predicted 650000 INR vs. Actual 850000 INR
   - Task 8: Predicted 200000 INR vs. Actual 270000 INR
   - Task 10: Predicted 900000 INR vs. Actual 1200000 INR
   Occurrences: 7

2. **Overestimation of Market Value**:
   - Task 1: Predicted 60000 INR vs. Actual 40000 INR
   - Task 5: Predicted 450000 INR vs. Actual 330000 INR
   - Task 9: Predicted 100000 INR vs. Actual 65000 INR
   Occurrences: 3

3. **Misjudgment of Vehicle Condition**:
   - This category could potentially include any of the wrong predictions where the condition of the vehicle (e.g., km driven, year, owner) might have been misjudged, but without specific evidence in the explanations, it's hard to distinctly categorize any under this based solely on the provided data.

4. **Incorrect Weighting of Attributes**:
   - This could be inferred for most wrong predictions as the importance given to certain attributes might not align well with their actual impact on the market value. However, without a correct model to compare against, it's speculative to assign any specific task to this category based solely on the provided data.

5. **Neglect of Critical Attributes**:
   - Similar to the ""Incorrect Weighting of Attributes,"" this category would imply that some critical attributes were either overlooked or not given enough importance in the prediction process. Again, without a baseline for comparison, it's challenging to definitively place any task in this category based on the provided information.

Given the nature of the explanations and the actual outcomes, most of the wrong decisions can be primarily grouped into ""Underestimation of Market Value"" and ""Overestimation of Market Value."" The other categories, such as ""Misjudgment of Vehicle Condition,"" ""Incorrect Weighting of Attributes,"" and ""Neglect of Critical Attributes,"" require a deeper analysis of the decision-making process and comparison with a correct model, which is not provided in the given data. Therefore, based on the explicit information available, we can only confidently categorize the errors into underestimation and overestimation of market value.",structured_analysis

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Based on the provided examples of false predictions, we can categorize the wrong decisions into three fault categories:

1. **Underestimation of Market Value**:
   - This occurs when the predicted price is significantly lower than the actual selling price. It suggests that the model might not fully account for certain attributes that add value to the car or may underestimate the impact of positive attributes (e.g., low mileage, recent year of manufacture, desirable features).
   - Examples: Task 2 (Prediction: 180000, Actual: 270000), Task 3 (Prediction: 150000, Actual: 210000), Task 4 (Prediction: 350000, Actual: 500000), Task 6 (Prediction: 750000, Actual: 1000000), Task 7 (Prediction: 650000, Actual: 850000), Task 8 (Prediction: 200000, Actual: 270000), Task 10 (Prediction: 900000, Actual: 1200000).
   - Occurrences: 7

2. **Overestimation of Depreciation**:
   - This fault occurs when the predicted price is significantly higher than the actual selling price. It suggests that the model might overvalue certain attributes or not adequately consider factors that significantly depreciate the car's value (e.g., high mileage, older model years, less desirable features).
   - Examples: Task 1 (Prediction: 60000, Actual: 40000), Task 5 (Prediction: 450000, Actual: 330000), Task 9 (Prediction: 100000, Actual: 65000).
   - Occurrences: 3

3. **Misinterpretation of Attributes**:
   - This category is for predictions where the model might have misinterpreted or incorrectly weighted the importance of certain attributes, leading to a wrong prediction. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the market's valuation of specific car features, conditions, or a combination of attributes that the model did not accurately assess.
   - However, based on the provided examples, all wrong decisions seem to fall clearly into the first two categories, with no distinct examples of misinterpretation of attributes as a separate fault category.

In summary, the wrong decisions predominantly fall into two main categories: underestimation of market value (7 occurrences) and overestimation of depreciation (3 occurrences).

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Analyzing the provided data, the wrong predictions can be grouped into three fault categories based on the nature of the errors made by the LLM. These categories are:

1. **Misjudgment of Market Value**:
   - This category includes predictions where the LLM seems to have inaccurately assessed the market value of the car based on its attributes. This could be due to a lack of understanding of how certain attributes like the car's brand, model, and specific features (e.g., engine size, max power) influence its price in the market.
   - Occurrences: Task 2 (Hyundai EON Era Plus), Task 3 (Chevrolet Optra Magnum 2.0 LT), Task 4 (Hyundai i20 1.4 CRDi Asta), Task 6 (Toyota Yaris V BSIV), Task 7 (Ford EcoSport 1.5 Petrol Titanium Plus BSIV), Task 8 (Honda City 2017-2020 GXi), Task 10 (Toyota Fortuner 3.0 Diesel).

2. **Overemphasis on Mileage and Engine Capacity**:
   - In this category, the LLM's predictions seem to be overly influenced by the car's mileage and engine capacity, potentially at the expense of considering other crucial factors such as the car's age, condition, and market demand for the model.
   - Occurrences: Task 5 (Toyota Innova 2.5 G (Diesel) 7 Seater BS IV).

3. **Underestimation of Depreciation Impact**:
   - Predictions in this category appear to underestimate the impact of depreciation, particularly for older models or cars with higher mileage. The LLM fails to account adequately for the significant loss in value that cars undergo as they age and as their mileage increases.
   - Occurrences: Task 1 (Maruti 800 Std), Task 9 (Maruti Wagon R LXI).

Summary of Occurrences:
- Misjudgment of Market Value: 7 occurrences
- Overemphasis on Mileage and Engine Capacity: 1 occurrence
- Underestimation of Depreciation Impact: 2 occurrences

This analysis suggests that the most common fault in the LLM's predictions is a misjudgment of the market value, indicating a potential area for improvement in understanding how various attributes contribute to a car's price in the market. Additionally, there's a need for better modeling of depreciation effects and a more balanced consideration of all relevant attributes beyond just mileage and engine capacity.",structured_analysis
error_class_LLM_nounderover_more_classes,"In the following I will give you a few price prediction tasks together with a prediction decision, details about the decision and the actual price.
A wrong prediction is a prediction that deviates by more than 20 percent from the actual price. The Prediction was made by an LLM.
Can you please group the wrong decisions into 5 fault categories? Please also indicate how often each one occurs.
There are also some correct decisions (deviation of less than 20 percent) in the examples. Please just use them as a reference and don't categorize them.
Please go deeper with your analysis and don't use Overestimation or Underestimation as categories.

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_zero_shot_pipeline_3.5-turbo,"Analyzing the provided false predictions, we can categorize the faults into five distinct categories based on the nature of the errors and the explanations provided. These categories are:

1. **Misjudgment of Market Value Due to Vehicle Age**:
   - This category includes predictions where the model significantly misjudged the impact of the vehicle's age on its market value.
   - Occurrences: Task 1 (Maruti 800 Std, 1999)

2. **Incorrect Weighting of Vehicle Condition and Ownership**:
   - Predictions falling into this category did not accurately account for the vehicle's condition (e.g., km driven, number of owners) in determining its value.
   - Occurrences: Task 3 (Chevrolet Optra Magnum, Fourth & Above Owner), Task 5 (Toyota Innova with high mileage)

3. **Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact**:
   - Here, the model failed to properly evaluate the impact of specific car models, their engine specifications, and features on the selling price.
   - Occurrences: Task 2 (Hyundai EON Era Plus), Task 4 (Hyundai i20 1.4 CRDi Asta), Task 6 (Toyota Yaris V BSIV), Task 7 (Ford EcoSport 1.5 Petrol Titanium Plus BSIV), Task 10 (Toyota Fortuner 3.0 Diesel)

4. **Overlooking Market Trends and Demand**:
   - Predictions in this category did not consider the current market trends and demand for certain vehicle types, leading to inaccurate price estimations.
   - Occurrences: None explicitly mentioned, but could be inferred in cases where the model's popularity or demand might have influenced actual prices significantly (e.g., Task 10's Toyota Fortuner).

5. **Misinterpretation of High Mileage Impact**:
   - This category includes predictions where the model failed to accurately assess the negative impact of high mileage on the vehicle's selling price.
   - Occurrences: Task 5 (Toyota Innova with 193623 km driven), Task 7 (Ford EcoSport with 90000 km driven)

**Frequency of Occurrences**:
- Misjudgment of Market Value Due to Vehicle Age: 1
- Incorrect Weighting of Vehicle Condition and Ownership: 2
- Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact: 5
- Overlooking Market Trends and Demand: 0 (inferred)
- Misinterpretation of High Mileage Impact: 2

**Summary**:
The most common fault category is the ""Underestimation of Model and Specifications Impact,"" with five occurrences, indicating that the model often fails to recognize the significant influence of specific car models, their engine specifications, and features on their market value. The next most common faults relate to the incorrect weighting of vehicle condition and ownership, and the misinterpretation of high mileage impact, each contributing to the model's inability to accurately predict used car prices.",structured_analysis
