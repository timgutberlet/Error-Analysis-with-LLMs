",gpt-4-turbo-preview,logistic_regression,"Based on the provided false decisions, we can categorize the errors made by the Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model into distinct fault categories. Here are the identified categories along with the frequency of each:

1. **Misinterpretation of Context or Negation**:
   - Task 1: The positive aspect of 'tables' is misinterpreted as negative due to possibly the model focusing on ""wish they had more"" without understanding the context.
   - Task 5: The model fails to recognize the implied negative sentiment towards 'meal' due to the lack of direct negative words, even though the context suggests dissatisfaction.
   - Task 7: The positive experience with the 'manager' is incorrectly marked as negative, possibly due to the model not capturing the overall positive context.
   - Task 17: The 'waiter' being promptly available at the start but then disappearing is a nuanced context that the model misinterprets as entirely negative.
   - Task 19: The model incorrectly assesses 'meat' as negative, failing to understand the context where the meat, onions, and cheese were good.
   - Occurrences: 5

2. **Incorrect Sentiment Polarity**:
   - Task 9: The model fails to recognize the negative sentiment towards 'eggs' being cold, marking it as neutral.
   - Task 11: The model marks 'salmon' as neutral despite the negative context of not being able to afford it.
   - Task 13: The model incorrectly marks 'portions' as negative despite the context indicating that large portions are a positive aspect.
   - Task 20: 'Rice pudding' is marked as negative despite no direct negative sentiment expressed towards it.
   - Occurrences: 4

3. **Failure to Recognize Positive Aspects**:
   - Task 3: The model marks 'menu' as neutral despite the positive experience described.
   - Task 6: 'Bagels' are marked as neutral despite the description of their perfect softness and crispiness, which is positive.
   - Task 10: The model fails to recognize the positive sentiment towards 'entrees' provided by the diverse array mentioned.
   - Task 12: 'Appetizers' are marked as neutral despite being described positively.
   - Task 14: The model marks 'chole' as neutral despite being part of a list of liked items.
   - Task 15: 'Delivery' is marked as neutral despite the context suggesting a positive aspect due to high demand.
   - Task 18: 'Red pepper hummus' is marked as neutral despite being offered as a compensatory gesture, which is positive.
   - Occurrences: 7

4. **Failure to Recognize Neutral Aspects**:
   - Task 16: The model incorrectly assigns a positive sentiment to 'texture', which is more of a neutral description.
   - Occurrences: 1

5. **Incorrect Neutral Sentiment Assignment**:
   - Task 2: The model marks 'food' as negative despite the context suggesting a neutral stance due to untouched food and drinks.
   - Task 4: 'Goat cheese' is marked as positive despite being part of a neutral description of the dish components.
   - Task 8: The model marks 'Scene' as neutral despite the context suggesting a positive aspect of popularity among locals.
   - Occurrences: 3

In summary, the errors can be grouped into five main categories, with the most common error being the failure to recognize positive aspects, occurring 7 times. Misinterpretation of context or negation and incorrect sentiment polarity are also significant, with 5 and 4 occurrences respectively. Incorrect neutral sentiment assignment and failure to recognize neutral aspects are less common, with 3 and 1 occurrences respectively.",logistic_regression

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_singleterm_zeroshot_gpt-4-turbo-preview,"The false decisions can be grouped into distinct fault categories as follows:

1. **Misinterpretation of Contextual Sentiment**:
   - Task 1: The sentiment towards ""stuff"" was influenced by negative descriptors (""greasy"", ""stinky"") but failed to recognize the overall positive sentiment of seeking a better alternative.
   - Task 13: The sentiment towards ""dish"" was neutral, failing to recognize the positive aspect of receiving something for free despite the critique of food quality.
   - Task 16: The sentiment towards ""main course"" was marked as negative based on the word ""ok"", not recognizing that ""ok"" in this context does not strongly denote negativity.
   - Task 17: The sentiment towards ""setting"" was marked as neutral, failing to recognize that being described in conjunction with ""average service"" implies a negative sentiment.
   - Occurrences: 4

2. **Incorrect Sentiment Attribution**:
   - Task 2: The sentiment towards ""menu"" was marked as negative due to price increase, which is an incorrect attribution as the sentiment towards the menu itself should remain neutral.
   - Task 4: The sentiment towards ""tomato and onions"" was marked as positive based on preference advice, which should not affect the neutral sentiment towards the ingredients themselves.
   - Task 5: The sentiment towards ""appetizers"" was marked as positive influenced by the service, which is an incorrect attribution.
   - Task 6: The sentiment towards ""chocolate sauce tic-tac-toe"" was marked as positive without a clear negative or positive aspect directly related to it.
   - Task 7: The sentiment towards ""wine"" was marked as positive influenced by service aspects, not the wine itself.
   - Task 8: The sentiment towards ""dishes"" was marked as negative due to being late, which affects the service, not the dishes themselves.
   - Task 9: The sentiment towards ""plates"" was marked as positive based on the food items, which should not directly influence the sentiment towards the plates themselves.
   - Task 10: The sentiment towards ""white sangria"" was marked as positive based on an assumption of being ""refreshing"", which is not directly stated.
   - Task 11: The sentiment towards ""Catfish"" was marked as positive influenced by the sauce, which is an incorrect attribution.
   - Task 12: The sentiment towards ""Hawaiian rib"" was marked as positive based on assumed qualities, not directly stated in the prompt.
   - Task 18: The sentiment towards ""goat cheese"" was marked as positive influenced by its pairing with ""smoked salmon"", which is an incorrect attribution.
   - Task 19: The sentiment towards ""bar"" was marked as positive based on hypothetical improvement to atmosphere, which is an incorrect attribution.
   - Task 20: The sentiment towards ""dessert"" was marked as positive based on the description of one option over another, which should not affect the overall sentiment towards ""dessert"" as a category.
   - Occurrences: 14

3. **Failure to Recognize Neutral Sentiment**:
   - Task 3: The sentiment towards ""dessert"" was marked as positive when it should have been neutral, as bringing a dessert does not inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment.
   - Task 14: The sentiment towards ""bar"" was marked as neutral, failing to recognize the negative sentiment implied by ""harsh lighting"".
   - Task 15: The sentiment towards ""salmon"" was marked as neutral, failing to recognize the negative sentiment implied by the inability to afford it.

   - This error type involves incorrectly classifying a neutral sentiment as either positive or negative (or vice versa) due to overemphasis on certain words or phrases that do not actually convey a strong sentiment towards the aspect.
   - Occurrences: Task 13 (positive to neutral), Task 16 (negative to neutral), Task 17 (neutral to negative), Task 19 (positive to negative)

3. **Overgeneralization of Sentiment**:
   - This fault occurs when the sentiment towards one aspect of a prompt is overgeneralized to another aspect, even when the sentiment towards the second aspect is not explicitly stated or is neutral.

Summary of Fault Categories and Frequencies:
- **Misinterpretation of Contextual Sentiment**: 14 occurrences
- **Neutral Misclassification**: 4 occurrences

",gpt-4-turbo-preview,structured_unstructured_singleterm_fix_fewshot_4-turbo-preview,"The false decisions can be grouped into distinct fault categories as follows:

   - Task 2 (Food): Positive sentiment was inferred from ""generous portions,"" ignoring the negative context of being expensive.
   - Task 3 (candle): Positive sentiment was inferred from the action of bringing a dessert with a candle, but the actual sentiment towards the candle itself was neutral.
   - Task 4 (pork chop): Negative sentiment was inferred from the description of accompanying sauces, but the actual sentiment towards the pork chop was neutral.
   - Task 5 (lounge): Negative sentiment was inferred from the lack of space, but the actual sentiment towards the lounge was neutral.
   - Task 6 (table): Negative sentiment was inferred from the waiting time, but the actual sentiment towards the table was neutral.

   - Task 15 (fish): Negative sentiment was inferred from the action of having to ""fish out"" a bottle, but the actual sentiment was neutral.
   - Task 16 (appetites): Negative sentiment was inferred from the phrase ""won't be enough,"" but the actual sentiment was positive.

Occurrences: 20

2. **Incorrect Sentiment Polarity**:
   - No clear cases where the sentiment polarity was simply reversed without context misinterpretation or detail oversight.

3. **Overgeneralization**:
   - Tasks where the sentiment towards a specific aspect was inferred based on the general sentiment of the sentence or another aspect, leading to incorrect predictions. This can be seen in tasks like Task 10 (menu), Task 14 (menu), and Task 15 (fish), where the sentiment towards the specific aspect was neutral, but the decision was influenced by the sentiment towards another aspect or the general situation.

Occurrences: Could be argued for several tasks, but the primary issue lies in misinterpretation or overlooking details.

In summary, the most common fault category is the **Misinterpretation of Context or Detail**, occurring in all 20 false decisions. There's no clear case of Incorrect Sentiment Polarity as a distinct category, and Overgeneralization is a potential sub-issue within the misinterpretation category, affecting the accurate understanding of the sentiment towards specific aspects.",unstructured_analysis

These categories encompass the primary types of errors made in the sentiment analysis tasks. The most common fault category is the misinterpretation of context or modifier, where the sentiment towards a term is incorrectly identified due to misunderstanding the context or the impact of modifiers in the sentence. This category includes errors where a positive or negative sentiment is assigned when it should be neutral, or vice versa, and also includes cases where the sentiment is completely opposite to what the context suggests. The incorrect sentiment polarity category is less frequent and involves cases where the sentiment is identified correctly as either positive or negative but is assigned the wrong polarity.",structured_analysis
error_class_LLM,"In the following I will give you a few Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis tasks together with a sentiment decision, details about the decision and the actual sentiment towards each term.
The Prediction was made by an LLM.
Can you please group the wrong decisions into distinct fault categories? Please also indicate how often each one occurs.
There are also some correct decisions in the examples. Please just use them as a reference and don't categorize them.
False Decisions:
Task 1:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""If you are looking for service and all the frills $$$ - Il Mulino is the best for both - if you are looking for a fabulous dinner in/out - this restaurant is it!""
Term: service
Output: neutral


Example 2:
Input: ""Don't know about the rest of the food, but the burgers are one of New York's hidden treats.""
Term: burgers

Term: priced
Output: negative

    
Task:
Input: I love Chinese food and have been looking for the alternative to the greasy stuff on every corner of New York- ya, you know, the stinky take-out joints that leave you smelling like dinner for 100 for the rest of the night!
Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'dinner'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: negative
Explanation: The prediction was made based on the context in which ""dinner"" was mentioned. The phrase ""stinky take-out joints that leave you smelling like dinner for 100 for the rest of the night"" carries a negative connotation. Words such as ""greasy,"" ""stinky,"" and the description of being left ""smelling like dinner for 100 for the rest of the night"" suggest a negative sentiment towards the concept of ""dinner"" in this context, as they imply unpleasant experiences associated with it. These word groups directly influence the sentiment to be negative.
Actual Sentiment: neutral
Task 2:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""If I went back, I'd have dinner in the bar--better service and even better atmosphere.""
Term: dinner
Output: neutral

Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'fries'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: negative
Explanation: The prediction was made based on the phrase ""I've had better burgers and fries at the local diner."" This indicates a comparison where the subject implies that the burgers and fries mentioned are inferior to those available at another specified location (""3 guys diner on 96th and Madison Avenue""). The key phrase influencing the decision is ""I've had better,"" which directly suggests a negative sentiment towards the quality of the fries discussed.
Actual Sentiment: positive
Task 3:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""The prices did not reflect the quality of the meal.""
Term: prices
Output: negative


Example 2:
Input: ""We did not get asked how I meal was nor did we get to our refill on waters until pretty much after the steak was finished.""

Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'single drink'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: negative
Explanation: The prediction of ""negative"" sentiment towards the term ""single drink"" was influenced by the context in which it was mentioned. The phrases ""did not refill a single drink"" and ""nowhere to be found at all throughout the course of the meal"" indicate a lack of service and attention, specifically highlighting the failure to refill any drinks. These expressions directly relate to the service associated with the ""single drink,"" portraying it in a negative light due to the absence of expected service actions.
Actual Sentiment: neutral
Task 4:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""I have a litany of complaints -- being over-charged for wine that I didn't order, shady waiters, so-so food that arrived at the table luke warm, main course portion sizes barely large enough to be appetizer sizes, lack of fabulosity that Mr.""
Term: wine
Output: neutral


Example 2:
Input: ""I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.""
Term: prices
Output: negative


Example 3
Input: ""Some advice: have the prime rib if it is a special, try a price fix lunch or dinner because it is an exceptional value.""
Term: prime rib
Output: positive

    
Task:
Input: My only advice is: increase portion sizes; and develop a special drink list.
Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'drink list'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: positive
Explanation: The prediction was made based on the context in which the term ""drink list"" was mentioned. The phrase ""develop a special drink list"" suggests a constructive or positive action, indicating an improvement or enhancement. The word ""special"" carries a positive connotation, implying that the drink list would be a beneficial addition or upgrade. Therefore, the sentiment towards the ""drink list"" is interpreted as positive.
Actual Sentiment: neutral
Task 5:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""A lot of energy and I loved the actors who came to our table.""
Term: actors
Output: positive

Input: ""Their dumplings have a LOT of chicken in them.""
Term: dumplings
Output: neutral

    
Task:
Input: There were a lot of scensters who couldnt afford dinner hanging in the waiting area so we got bumped around a lot.
Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'dinner'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: neutral
Explanation: The prediction was made by analyzing the sentiment of the text in relation to the term ""dinner."" The text does not directly express any sentiment towards the quality, enjoyment, or experience of ""dinner"" itself. Instead, it focuses on the presence of ""scensters who couldn't afford dinner"" and the inconvenience caused by being ""bumped around"" in the waiting area. The words directly associated with ""dinner"" (""couldnt afford"") do not inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment towards the dinner experience or quality. Therefore, the sentiment towards ""dinner"" is determined as ""neutral"" because the text neither praises nor criticizes dinner itself, but rather discusses external factors related to the dining environment.
Actual Sentiment: negative
Task 6:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""I had six different items on the menu (yes, I am a trencherman) and three were simply OUTSTANDING: the steak, the sweetbreads (best I've ever had), and the monkfish liver (also the best I've ever had).""
Term: menu
Output: neutral


Example 2:
Input: ""Appetizers were OK, steak was not as good as what I would have prepared at home on the grill.""
Term: Appetizers
Output: positive


Example 3
Input: ""If you want to have fresh grill fish served just with virgin olive oil and lemon Telly's Taverna is the place for you.""
Term: grill fish served
Output: positive

    
Task:
Input: Telly's has the best octopus ever and the fish was so good on the grill.
Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'grill'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: positive
Explanation: The prediction of ""positive"" sentiment towards the term ""grill"" was influenced by the phrase ""the fish was so good on the grill."" This phrase directly associates the quality of the fish with being cooked on the grill, implying a positive experience and outcome due to the grilling process. The use of ""so good"" as a descriptor for the fish prepared on the grill strongly suggests a positive sentiment towards the method of cooking, hence influencing the decision towards a positive sentiment for the term ""grill.""
Actual Sentiment: neutral
Task 7:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""The food was ok, good bread.""
Term: food
Output: neutral


Example 2:
Input: ""I ordered their famous buffalo steak which originally would come with homemade potatoe gnocchi but I chose the sauteed spinach with garlic instead, which turned out to be exceptional.""
Term: buffalo steak

Term: table
Output: neutral

    
Task:

Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'Food'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: positive
Explanation: The prediction of ""positive"" towards the term ""Food"" was influenced by the description of the ""classic Italian menu"" getting off to a ""good start"" with a ""famous bread basket,"" which is described as ""loaded with a slew of crunchy, yeasty homemade varieties."" These phrases suggest a positive experience with the food, emphasizing quality and enjoyment. Words like ""good start,"" ""famous,"" ""loaded,"" ""crunchy,"" ""yeasty,"" and ""homemade"" carry positive connotations that directly contribute to the sentiment.
Actual Sentiment: neutral

Task:
Input: The Scene Hunky waiters dub diners darling and it sounds like they mean it.
Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'Scene'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: positive
Explanation: The prediction of ""positive"" sentiment towards the term ""Scene"" was influenced by the description of the environment, specifically through the phrases ""Hunky waiters"" and ""dub diners darling,"" which carry positive connotations. The phrase ""it sounds like they mean it"" further supports a genuine, positive atmosphere. These elements together suggest a favorable and appealing scene, leading to the positive sentiment classification.

Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'ravioli'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: negative
Explanation: The prediction was made based on the description of the ravioli, which included both a positive aspect (""the better of the two"") and negative aspects (""serving was tiny, and the skin a bit rubbery""). The negative aspects, especially the criticism about the serving size and the texture of the ravioli (""tiny"" and ""rubbery""), had a higher influence on the decision, leading to a negative sentiment towards the ravioli.
Actual Sentiment: positive
Task 10:
Prompt: Example 1:
Input: ""Thin crust, lots of sauce and very little cheese, it's not your typical Sicilian slice of pizza, but can't explain why I have a hard time eating less than 4 of those babies!""

Prompt: What is the sentiment in the text towards 'sauce'? Only respond with ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""neutral"" as one word.
Sentiment Decision: neutral
Explanation: The prediction was based on the specific mention of ""sauce isn't too sugary."" This phrase indicates a preference or a positive aspect of the sauce by highlighting what it is not, rather than criticizing or expressing dislike for its qualities. The absence of a negative descriptor and the implication that the sauce's sweetness level is appropriate or desirable led to the classification as ""neutral."" The decision was influenced by the lack of explicit positive enthusiasm or negative criticism towards the sauce, suggesting a more neutral stance.
Actual Sentiment: positive
